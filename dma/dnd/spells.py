Briefly, the <i>ceremonies</i> listed do the following things:\n\n"
            "<i>Coming of age</i> is a limited form of <a href=\"/spells/bless-cleric-lvl-1\"><i>bless</i></a> spell which is cast upon a young man (and in some cultures a young woman) at some point relatively early in life, often the age of 12. A young person who receives this spell gets a +1 bonus to any single saving throw, which can be taken at any time after the <i>coming of age ceremony</i> is completed. In some cultures, the <i>coming of age ceremony</i> has a symbolic significance, such that an adolescent must receive this blessing before he or she can enjoy the rights and privileges of adulthood.\n\n"
            "<i>Burial</i> magically protects a corpse, and bestows it with the blessing of the religious organization. The body is shielded for one week as if by a <a href=\"/spells/protection-from-evil-cleric-lvl-1/\"><i>protection from evil</i></a> spell, and anyone trying to disinter the corpse within that time must make a saving throw versus spell or stop and flee in fear for one turn.\n\n"
            "<i>Marriage</i> has no tangible after-effect (i.e., it does not guarantee happiness or harmony), but it usually carries a moral or legal significance, not dissimilar in nature to the various rites of marriage which are performed in our real world.\n\n"
            "<i>Dedication</i> allows the recipient of the spell to be taken into the ranks of the casting cleric's religion, making that person a sanctioned worshiper of the cleric's deity. The effect of a <i>dedication</i> is permanent, unless the worshiper demonstrates a desire to change allegiance to a different deity. In such a case, the earlier <i>dedication</i> can be overridden by a new <i>dedication</i> cast by a cleric of a higher level than the one who performed the previous <i>dedication</i>.\n\n"
            "The rite of <i>investiture</i> must be performed on any aspiring cleric before that character can achieve the status of a first-level cleric.\n\n"
            "<i>Consecrate item</i> must be performed on any object to be placed on an altar or some other location within a religious edifice. To prevent it from losing its potency, holy (or unholy) water must be kept in a properly <i>consecrated</i> container.\n\n"
            "<i>Ordination</i> must be performed on a cleric before the character can become the priest of a congregation or assume similar sorts of duties, and even an adventuring cleric must be <i>ordained</i> before he or she can gain followers and establish a following or other sort of group. In all cases, the cleric performing the <i>ordination</i> must be of higher level than the recipient; this <i>ceremony</i> is often conducted as part of the training a cleric receives in order to advance from second to third level.\n\n"
            "<i>Special vows</i> can be received by a would-be cavalier or paladin before that character embarks upon a career in the desired profession. The effects of this spell persist for as long as it takes the character to accumulate enough experience points to rise to the upper limit of his or her current level. The <i>special vows</i> can then be renewed as part of the character's training between levels, or at any time during advancement through the next higher level. A cavalier or paladin who has received <i>special vows</i> is immune to the effects of <a href=\"/spells/remove-curse-cleric-lvl-3/\"><i>bestow curse</i></a> spells (but not cursed items) for as long as the <i>special vows</i> remain in effect. Additionally, this <i>ceremony</i> renders the subject more susceptible (-4 on saving throw) to any <i>quest</i> spell cast upon him or her by a cleric of the same alignment as the caster of the <i>special vows</i>.\n\n"
            "<i>Consecrate ground</i> should be performed upon an area before any holy (unholy) structure is built on the site. A religious edifice constructed on ground that has not been <i>consecrated</i> will slowly but irrevocably fall into a state of disrepair and has a 1% chance per year, cumulative, of actually collapsing as a result of this oversight. This spell must be cast before the area in question is altered in any way (e.g., landscaping) and before any construction materials are brought to the site; it will have no effect if it is done as an afterthought. <i>Consecrate ground</i> can also be used on a plot of land destined for use as a graveyard, and in such case the graveyard itself automatically turns undead each round with the same effectiveness as a 3rd-level cleric. Or, if the <i>consecration</i> of a would-be graveyard is performed by an evil cleric, any undead creatures occupying the area are treated as if they were being protected and controlled by an evil cleric of 3rd level.\n\n"
            "<i>Anathematize</i> is a form of excommunication by means of which the offender is literally branded on the cheek, forehead, arm, or hand with a symbol, sigil, or sign that identifies the subject (to those who understand the symbol) as someone who has committed a serious offense in the eyes of his or her deity. An unwilling subject of this spell is allowed a saving throw versus spell, at -4, to escape its effects. If the recipient is not truly deserving of the telling brand, the spell fails when cast. A successful <a href=\"/spells/atonement-cleric-lvl-5/\"><i>atonement</i></a> causes the brand to fade, and possibly vanish. If the offending actions were caused magically or by some other external force, the brand utterly disappears. If the offending actions were natural, the brand cannot be completely removed.\n\n"
            "The components for the various <i>ceremony</i> spells vary from religion to religion, but the material component always involves the use of the cleric's holy symbol in one way or another. Standard costs for the casting of these spells are as follows: <i>coming of age</i>, 5-15 sp; <i>burial</i>, 5-50 gp; <i>marriage</i>, 1-20 gp; <i>dedication</i>, 1-10 sp (or sometimes free); <i>investiture</i>, 1-100 gp (or sometimes free); <i>item consecration</i>, usually free; <i>ordination</i>, usually free but possibly as much as 200 gp; <i>special vows</i>, 1-100 gp (or sometimes free); <i>consecrate groud</i>, 100-600 gp depending on the size of the area to be affected and the level of the cleric performing the spell; and <i>anathematize</i> is always performed at no charge, since the casting of this spell is always deemed to be in the best interests of the cleric's religion."

This \"luck\" takes the form of an improvement or reduction in a \"to hit\" roll or a saving throw at some point in the future unknown to the character who is the object of the <i>portent</i>. After this spell is cast, the Dungeon Master makes two die rolls in secret: First, 1d12, to determine at what point in the future the <i>portent</i> takes effect; second, 1d6 to determine the exact effect (roll of 1 = -3; 2 = -2; 3 = -1; 4 = +1; 5 = +2; 6 = +3). Based upon the result of the 1d6 roll, the DM should indicate to the player of the cleric character whether the <i>portent</i> is good, fair(which can be moderately good or moderately bad), or poor. The recipient of the spell will usually also be given this information. The result of the d12 roll represents the number of \"to hit\" rolls or saving throws that the target character must make before the roll to be affected by the <i>portent</i> occurs; e.g. if a 12 is rolled, then the 12th such roll thereafter will be the one to which the <i>portent</i> is applied. Die rolls only apply toward this count if they are taken in life-or-death (i.e., combat or peril) situations; the count is suspended if the character contrives to perform (for instance) saving throws against non-harmful effects in an effort to \"sidestep\" the <i>portent</i>. Die rolls that do apply toward this count include: Saving throws made in combat or against magical effects, \"to hit\" rolls made by an opponent against the character. When the die roll designated by the <i>portent</i> is made, the result will be adjusted upward or downward as indicated by the result of the d6 roll; thus, the character will be either more or less likely to succeed on a saving throw.

It is magic, each of its missiles being equal to a +3 weapon, and there is no non-proficiency penalty for its use.

The bridge is as many feet wide as the cleric has levels of experience, and it can bear as much weight, in hundreds of pounds, as the cleric has levels of experience. It will be at least 20' long and can be as long as 120', according to the desire of the caster.

The effect is to carry the cleric and others, if any, in a path arching upward to as high an altitude as the cleric desires, and then down again if desired. Care must be taken to reach a place of safety before the spell duration expires, or the rainbow elevator will disappear, leaving those treading upon it with no means of support.

The animated object, or objects, then attack whomever or whatever the cleric first designates. The object can be of any material whatsoever — wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. The speed of movement of the object is dependent upon its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 1\" per round, a stone statue would move at 4\" per round, a wooden statue 8\" per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 12\". Slithering movement is about 1\" to 2\" per round, rolling 3\" to 6\" per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object is dependent upon its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip. smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1-2 hit points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium weight objects can crush or strike for 2-8 hit points of damage, those larger and heavier doing 3-12, 4-16, or even 5-20 hit points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects is dependent upon their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per melee round. The armor class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability with regard to hitting. Damage is dependent upon the type of weapon and the object struck. A sharp cutting weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your referee will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The cleric can animate 1 cubic foot of material for each level of experience he or she has attained.

In other respects it is similar to the <a href=\"/spells/ceremony-cleric-lvl-1/\">clerical <i>ceremony</i></a> of the same name.\n\n"
            "<i>Investiture</i> is a rite that must be performed upon a character before he or she can become an Aspirant (1st-level druid). It conveys no other benefit.\n\n"
            "<i>Initiation</i> imbues the druid with the shape-changing and immunity to woodland <i>charm</i> powers that become available to the character upon attaining 7th level. This <i>ceremony</i> must be performed upon a druid immediately after he or she begins to advance upward through the 7th level of experience; if cast earlier than this, it will not work, and the druid will not have the benefit of the above-mentioned special powers until receiving <i>initiation</i>. Usually a druid must seek out another druid of 7th or higher level to perform the rite, but in unusual cases a druid may cast it upon himself or herself.\n\n"
            "<i>Special vows</i> is a <i>ceremony</i> that operates in the same fashion as the clerical rite of the same name. It does not work upon paladins, but will function upon cavaliers of any alignment.\n\n"
            "<i>Hallowed ground</i> is cast by the druid on his or her permanent grove. This <i>ceremony</i> ensorcels the trees of the grove so that they will never be affected by disease or natural disasters.

Its effects may be lessened at a later date by the casting of the reversed version of this <i>ceremony</i>, either by the same druid or another one of at least as high a level as the original caster, but the <i>casting out</i> can never be completely neutralized except by a Hierophant Druid of any level. A character who has been <i>cast out</i> exudes a powerful negative aura, causing any natural creature encountered to react negatively to the character. This includes all normal (non-magical) animals, monsters native to the woodlands, domesticated beasts such as horses and dogs, and all druids and their followers.\n\n"
            "<i>Casting out</i> is a very powerful form of punishment, and can only be performed by a druid who has received permission from his or her Archdruid to do so. Similarly, an Archdruid must get permission from the Great Druid, and the Great Druid from the Grand Druid. The Grand Druid does not need to obtain permission, but his or her actions may be reversed by a Hierophant Druid at any time.\n\n"

Note that any consequences of this use of the item fall fully upon the magic-user, although any saving throw normally allowed is still the privilege of the magic-user. For each segment the spell is in force, it is 15% + 5% per level of the magic-user probable that 1 property of the object touched can become known — possibly that the item has no properties and is merely a ruse (the presence of <a href=\"/spells/nystuls-magic-aura-magic-user-lvl-1/\"><i>Nystul's Magic Aura</i></a> or a <a href=\"/spells/magic-mouth-magic-user-lvl-2/\"><i>magic mouth</i></a> being detected). Each time a property can be known, the referee will secretly roll to see if the magic-user made his or her saving throw versus magic. If the save was successful, the property is known; if it is 1 point short, a false power will be revealed; and if it is lower than 1 under the required score no information will be gained. The item will never reveal its exact plusses to hit or its damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many such plusses can be discovered. If it has charges, the object will never reveal the exact number, but it will give information which is +/-25% of actual i.e. a wand with 40 charges could feel as if it had 30, or 50, or any number in between. The item to be <i>identified</i> must be examined by the magic-user within 1 hour per level of experience of the examiner after it has been discovered, or all readable impressions will have been blended into those of the characters who have possessed it since. After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the magic-user loses 8 points of constitution. He or she must rest for 6 turns per 1 point in order to regain them. If the 8 point loss drops the spell caster below a constitution of 3, he or she will fall unconscious, and consciousness will not be regained until full constitution is restored 24 hours later.

If a <i>luckstone</i> is powdered and added to the infusion, probability increases 25% and all saving throws are made at +4."

            "The arcing bolt will continue until it has struck the appropriate number of objects, as indicated by a target's failure to save or lack of the opportunity to do so (as for an inanimate object of non-magical nature), until the stroke fades out or strikes a target that grounds it. Direction is never a consideration in plotting the path of the arcing <i>chain lightning</i>. Distance is a factor, though; a single arc can never be longer than the range limit. If, in order to arc, the bolt must travel a greater distance than its maximum range, the stroke fades into nothing. A tree or a substantial piece of conductive metal — such as interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage — will ground the lightning stroke and prevent further arcing.\n\n"
            "The lightning inflicts one less d6 of damage on each target it hits after striking the primary target for the first time; if the initial target was struck by a 12d6 bolt, the next target struck takes an 11d6 bolt, then 10d6, 9d6, 8d6, 7d6, and so on all the way down to 1d6 — the last spurt of energy from the bolt. (A saving throw for half damage applies on each strike, different from the save versus spell to see if the lightning actually hits a secondary target.) The caster can be struck by an arc from his or her own spell. The material components are a bit of fur; an amber, glass or crystal rod; and as many silver pins as the spell caster has levels of experience."

With respect to requirement 3), it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, and/or engraved; however, if such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, these are required for the item to be magicked.\n\n"

All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1' distant from the spell caster, for if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic may be performed, and the magic-user must remain quiet and in isolation.) At the end of the spell, the caster will \"know\" that the item is ready for the final test. He or she will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the magic-user who magicked it) versus magic, the spell is completed. (Note that the spell caster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to but not exceeding +3.) A result of 1 on the die (d20) always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the magic-user may begin to place the desired dweomer upon the item, and the spell he or she plans to place on or within the item must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must again be enchanted.\n\n"

This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive dweomer must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if any prior spell failed.\n\n"
            "No magic placed on or into an item is permanent unless a <i>permanency</i> spell is used as a finishing touch, and this always runs a risk of draining a point of constitution from the magic-user casting the spell. It is also necessary to point out that while it is possible to tell when the basic (<i>enchant an item</i>) spell succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually take, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, items that are charged — rods, staves, wands, <i>javelins of lightning</i>, <i>ring of wishes</i>, etc. — can never be made permanent.

The spell causes an awareness of a <a href=\"/spells/gate-cleric-lvl-7/\"><i>gate</i></a>-like opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a <i>gate</i>. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its intelligence score on 3d6. The score modified by the difference between the creature's intelligence and that of the spell caster's. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spell caster has a higher score, the difference is added to the total of the 3d6.\n\n"
            "If the saving throw succeeds the creature merely ignores the spell-created opening, and the dweomer fails. If the saving throw is not made, the creature steps into the opening and is <i>ensnared</i>. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this also must be used in casting of the <i>ensnarement</i> spell.\n\n"
            "When actually ensnared, the creature coming from another plane to that of the spell caster is not constrained from harming the one who trapped it. Therefore, the caster uses a magic circle (for creatures from the upper planes or the Astral Plane), a thaumatugic triangle (for creatures from the Ethereal, Elemental, or Concordant Opposition planes), or a pentagram (for creatures from the lower and infernal planes). Regardless of such protection, there is a chance that the entrapped creature will be able to break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spell caster. The base chance for an ensnared creature to break free depends on the manner in which the confining design was made. A hand-done one has a base chance of 20% of being broken, one inlaid or carved has only a base of 10%. and that for the first time only (which indicates whether or not the job was done properly). This base chance is modified by the total score of the magic-user's combined intelligence and experience level compared to the intelligence and the experience level or number of hit dice of the creature summoned. If the spell caster has a higher total, that difference is subtracted from the percentage chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.\n\n"
            "The chance may be further modified by care in preparation of the protective symbol. If the hand-made protection is inscribed over a long period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp per turn of application), the chance of an <i>ensnared</i> creature breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent so preparing; i.e. an expenditure of 1 turn and 1,000 gp reduces the chance of breaking free by 1%. This can bring the base chance to 0%, but the further modifications for intelligence and level/hit dice still must be made thereafter, and no amount of special preparation can negate that risk. Similarly, an inlaid or inscribed design can be brought to 0% chance of being broken by inlaying it with various metals, minerals, etc. This effort will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the protection inlaid or inscribed into stone. Any breaking of the lines of protection or blurring of the glyphs, runes, and sigils which guard the magical barrier will spoil the efficacy of the dweomer and allow the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw droppped across the lines of a circle destroy its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed protective device, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.\n\n"
            "Once safely <i>ensnared</i>, the creature can be kept for as long as the spell caster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the inscription!) The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature. The DM will then assign a value to what the magic-user has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6. This rating is then subtracted from the intelligence score of the creature. If the creature makes its saving throw, a score equal to or less than its adjusted intelligence, it will refuse service. New offers, bribes, etc. can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to release it by means of some riddance spell. It need not be stressed that certain other spells can be used to force a captive creature into submission.\n\n"

For example, if iron, holy water, sunstone, and a sprig of rosemary were used in casting a <i>banishment</i> upon a demon, its saving throw versus the spell would be made at -8 (four substances times the factor of 2). Special items, such as hair from the tail of a ki-rin, or couatl feathers, could also be added to bring the factor up to -3 or -4 per such item. In contrast, a devil's scale or titan's hair, or mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower the factor to -1 with respect to a demon. If the subject creature makes its saving throw versus the spell, the caster will be stung by a backlash of energy, take 2-12 points of damage, and be stunned for 2-12 segments.\n\n"

Note that this spell is <i>not</i> of sufficient power to bring a demon of greater power, and lesser sorts are not called as they have no known names. In any event, the spell caster <i>must</i> know the name of the type IV, V, or VI demon he or she is summoning. As the spell name implies, the demon so summoned is most angry and evilly disposed. The spell caster must be within a circle of <i>protection</i> (or a thaumaturgic triangle with <a href=\"/spells/protection-from-evil-cleric-lvl-1/\"><i>protection from evil</i></a>) and the demon confined within a pentagram (circled pentacle) if he or she is to avoid being slain or carried off by the summoned cacodemon. The summoned demon can be treated with as follows:\n\n"
            "1) The magic-user can require the monster to perform a desired course of action by force of threat and pain of a <a href=\"/spells/spiritwrack-magic-user-lvl-6/\"><i>spiritwrack</i></a> spell, allowing freedom whenever the demon performs the full extent of the service, and forcing the demon to pledge word upon it. This is exceedingly dangerous, as a minor error in such a bargain will be seized upon by the monster to reverse the desired outcome or simply to kill and devour the summoner. Furthermore, the demon will bear great enmity for the magic-user forever after such forced obedience, so the spell caster had better be most powerful and capable.\n\n"
            "2) By tribute of fresh human blood and the promise of 1 or more human sacrifices, the summoner can bargain with the demon for willing service. Again, the spell caster is well advised to have ample protection and power to defend himself or herself, as the demon might decide the offer is insufficient — or it is easier to enjoy the summoner's slow death — and decide not to accept the bargain as offered. Although the demon will have to abide by a pledge, as his name is known, he will have to hold only to the exact word of the arrangement, not to the spirit of the agreement. On the other hand, only highly evil magic-users are likely to attempt to strike such a bargain, and the summoned <i>cacodemon</i> might be favorably disposed towards such a character, especially if he or she is also chaotic.\n\n"
            "3) The summoned demon can be the object of a <a href=\"/spells/trap-the-soul-magic-user-lvl-8/\"><i>trap the soul</i></a> spell. In this case, the magic-user will not speak with or bargain for the demon's services, although the <i>cacodemon</i> might be eager to reach an accord with the dweomercraefter before he is forced into imprisonment. The trapping of the demon is risky only if proper precautions have not been taken, for failure to confine the monster usually means only that it is able to escape to its own plane. Once trapped, the demon must remain imprisoned until the possessor of his object of confinement breaks it and frees him, and this requires one service from the now loosed monster. If the individual(s) freeing the demon fails to demand a service when the monster asks what is required of him, the demon is under no constraint not to slay the liberator(s) on the spot, but if a service is required, the creature must first do his best to perform it and then return to the Abyss.\n\n"
            "The duration of service of any demon must be limited unless the demon is willing to serve for an extended period. Any required course of action or service which effectively requires an inordinate period of time to perform, or is impossible to perform, is 50% likely to free the demon from his obligations and enable him to be unconstrained in his vengeance upon the spell caster if he or she is not thereafter continually protected, for a demon so freed can remain on the plane it was summoned to for as long as 666 days.\n\n"
            "The demon summoned will be exceptionally strong, i.e. 8 hit points per hit die.\n\n"
            "Casting time is 1 hour per type (numeric) of the demon to be summoned. If there is any interruption during this period, the spell fails. If there is an interruption while the <i>cacodemon</i> is summoned, it is 10% probable that it will be able to escape its boundaries and attack the magic-user, this percentage rising cumulatively each round of continued interruption.\n\n"
            "Each demon is entitled to a saving throw versus this summoning spell. If a score higher than the level of the magic-user summoning is rolled with 3d6 (2d10 with respect to type VI demons), that particular spell failed to bring the desired demon. When this occurs, it is certain that the named demon is imprisoned or destroyed or the name used was not perfectly correct, so the spell caster will have to call upon another name to bring forth a cacodemon.\n\n"

The subject of the spell must be seen by the caster, and the magic-user must know the subject's true name as well when the final word is uttered. Preparatory to the actual casting of the <i>trap the soul</i>, the magic-user must prepare the soul prison, a gem of 1,000 g.p. value for every hit die or level of experience the creature whose soul is to be trapped possesses, i.e. it requires a gem of 10,000 g.p. value to trap a 10 hit dice (or 10th level) creature by placing an <a href=\"/spells/enchant-an-item-magic-user-lvl-6/\"><i>enchant an item</i></a> spell upon it and then placing a <a href=\"/spells/maze-magic-user-lvl-8/\"><i>maze</i></a> spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison for the soul to be trapped.

The final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range, but this entitles it to exercise its magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw versus magic as well, and if the latter is successful, the gem shatters. The second method of soul trapping is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word which will automatically place the creature's soul into the trap. If this method is used, it will be necessary to name the triggering item when the prison gem is magicked. A <a href=\"/spells/antipathysympathy-magic-user-lvl-8/\"><i>sympathy</i></a> spell may be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its soul is automatically transferred to the gem. The gem prison will hold the soul trapped until time indefinite, or until it is broken and the soul is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the creature trapped is a powerful creature from another plane (and this could actually mean a character trapped by some inhabitant of another plane of existence when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed.
