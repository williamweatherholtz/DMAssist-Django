Thus, if 11-19 is rolled, a roll of 20 saves, 20-29 allows a 19-20 to save, 30-39 allows 18-20, and so on. Example: An illusionist casts a <a href="/spells/maze-illusionist-lvl-5"><i>maze</i></a> spell upon a fighter wearing a <i>ring of spell turning</i>. The <i>maze</i> spell normally allows no saving throw, but the ring turns 34% of the spell effect.

The illusionist mmust also save (100% - 34% = 66%, or 6 10% increments, which converts to a 30% chance to save) by rolling a 15-20 or be <i>mazed</i> also. Saving in this case will negate spell effect. This special saving throw is NOT modified by race, magic items, or any other condition, including existing spells.\n\n'

Range is 6" +1" per clerical level of the user. The number of insects produced is 60 plus 10 per level. Every 10 insects will inflict 1 point of damage upon the target victim, regardless of armor class, unless the victim is protected by a force field, engulfed in flames, etc. Note, however, that the insects will not affect creatures larger than man-sized with a natural armor class of 5 or better. When a vulnerable target is attacked by the swarm of flying insects, the creature will be unable to do anything other than attempt to dislodge/kill the things. The insect attack lasts for 1 round.

If slain in animal-like form the <i>figurine</i> simply reverts to its statuette conformation and can be used again at a later time as long as the statuette is not broken. When <i>figurines of wondrous power</i> are indicated, roll on the table below to determine the type:\n\n'
        '01-15: ebony fly\n'

        '66-85: onyx dog\n'
        '86-00: serpentine owl\n\n'
        '<i>Ebony Fly</i>: At a word the small carving grows to the size of a pony. The <i>ebony fly</i> is armor class 4, has 4+4 hit dice, air maneuverability class C, and flies at 48" movement rate without a rider, at 36" carrying up to 210 pounds weight, and 24" carrying from 211 to 350 pounds weight. The item can be used a maximum of 3 times per week, 12 hours per day. When 12 hours have expired, or in any event when the command word is spoken, the <i>ebony fly</i> shrinks to statuette size.\n\n'
        '<i>Golden Lions</i>: A pair of <i>golden lions</i> are exceptionally useful as they become 2 normal adult male lions (armor class 5/6, 5+2 hit dice, and normal attack modes). If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week; otherwise, they can be used once every day. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.\n\n'
        '<i>Ivory Goats</i>: Each goat of this trio of statuettes looks slightly different, for each has a different function. These are:\n\n'
        '1. <i>The Goat of Travelling</i>: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount of armor class 6, with 24 hit points and 2 attacks (horns) for 1-8 each (consider as 4 hit dice monster). It moves at 48" bearing 280 pounds or less, and at -1" for every additional 14 pounds of weight carried. The goat can travel a maximum of 1 day each week - continuously or in any combination of periods totalling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its small form for not less than 1 day before it can again be used.\n\n'
        '2. <i>The Goat of Travail</i>: When commanded, this statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with sharp hooves (4-10/4-10), a vicious bite (2-8), and a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (2-12/2-12). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns, but +6 damage is added to each hit on that round, i.e., 8-18 h.p. damage per horn. It is armor class 0, has 96 hit points, and attacks as a 16 hit dice monster. It can be called to life but once per month. It moves 24".\n\n'
        '3. <i>The Goat of Terror</i>: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, 36" movement, armor class 2, 48 hit points, and no attacks itself. However, its rider can employ the goat\'s horns as weapons, one horn as a +3 spear (lance), the other as a +6 sword. When ridden versus an opponent, the <i>goat of terror</i> radiates <i>terror</i> in a 3" radius, and any opponent in this radius must make a saving throw versus magic or lose 50% of strength and suffer at least -3 on "to hit" dice rolls, all due to weakness caused by terror. When all opponents are slain, or upon the proper command, the <i>goat</i> returns to its statuette form. It can be used once every 2 weeks.\n\n'
        'After 3 uses each of the <i>goats</i> loses its magical abilities forever.\n\n'
        '<i>Marble Elephant</i>: These are the largest of the <i>figurines</i>, each statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a <i>marble elephant</i> can be caused to grow to the size and specifications of a true elephant or return to statuette form. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to its commander, serving as a beast of burden, mount, or attacking alone. The type of <i>marble elephant</i> obtained is determined as follows:\n\n'
        '01-50: Asiatic (<a href="/creatures/elephant">Elephant</a>)\n'
        '51-90: African (<a href="/creatures/elephant">Loxodont</a>)\n'

        '94-00: Prehistoric (<a href="/creatures/mastodon">Mastodon</a>)\n\n'
        'The statuette can be used a maximum of 24 hours at a time, 4 times per month.\n\n'
        '<i>Obsidian Steed</i>: An <i>obsidian steed</i> appears as a small, nearly shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection will reveal that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped, and of course, if magic is detected for, the piece of rock which is the <i>steed</i> figurine will be noted as radiating some dweomer (magic). Upon speaking the command word, the near formless piece of obsidian becomes a true <a href="/creatures/nightmare"><i>nightmare</i></a>. It will allow itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, it is 10% likely per use to carry its "master" to the floor of <i>Hades\'</i> first layer and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used for a 24 hour period maximum, once per week. Note that when the <i>obsidian steed</i> becomes astral or ethereal its rider and gear likewise so become, thus travel to other planes is easily accomplished by means of this item.\n\n'
        '<i>Onyx Dog</i>: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature which has the same properties as a <a href="/creatures/war-dog"><i>war dog</i></a>, except that it is endowed with intelligence of 8-10, can communicate in the common tongue, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. The olfactory power enables the <i>onyx dog</i> to scent the trail of a known creature 100% of the time if it is 1 hour or less old, -10% per hour thereafter, and subject to being thrown off by false trails, breaks, water, and masking or blocking substances or scents. The visual power enables the <i>onyx dog</i> to use 90\' range infravision, spotting hidden (such as in shadows) things 80% of the time, normally invisible things 65% of the time, and noting astral, ethereal, and out-of-phase things 50% of the time. An <i>onyx dog</i> can be used for up to 6 continuous hours, once per week. It obeys only its owner.\n\n'
        '<i>Serpentine Owl</i>: A <i>serpentine owl</i> becomes a normal-sized horned <a href="/creatures/owl">owl</a> (AC 7; 24" move; 2-4 hit points; 1-2/1-2 hit points of damage when attacking) if its possessor so commands, or it can become a <a href="/creatures/giant-owl"><i>giant owl</i></a> if its owner so requires. The latter usage, however, is limited to 3 times; thereafter the statuette loses all of its magical properties. The <i>normal-sized</i> form of the magical statuette moves with 95% silence, has infravision to 90\', can see in normal, above ground darkness as if it were full light, and twice as well as a human at that. Its hearing is so keen as to be able to detect a mouse moving at 60\' distance; thus silent movement chances are reduced 50% with respect to the <i>serpentine owl</i> in smaller form. Furthermore, it can and will communicate with its owner by telepathic means, informing of all its sees and hears according to its (<i>low</i>, 2-4) intelligence in normal-size. If commanded to giant-size, a <i>serpentine owl</i> is in all respects the same as a <a href="/creatures/giant-owl"><i>giant owl</i></a>. As with most other <i>figurinesof wondrous power</i>, this one readily obeys all commands of its owner.\n\n'

The first individual to pick up the flagon will be able to read what is written, but no other can do so, normally or magically, until they become the owner of the vessel. The toast phrase is read to activate the flagon - and each time it is activated, the phrase changes. Recitation of the magical toasting words causes the flagon to fill with good-tasting, but rather weak, wine. Each time thereafter that the flagon is drained, it refills itself with better-tasting liquid. The weak wine initially therein is of about 7% alcohol content: The next liquid is about 10% alcohol, the third draught of wine is 13%, the fourth is port-like and about 20%, the fifth is a near-liquor of some 40% alcoholic content, and the sixth and last draught is brandy-like liquid of nearly 80% alochol. The typical flagon contains about 1 pint of liquid (16 ounces). It is 90% unlikely that any creature partaking of the first draught will notice the increase in alcohol of the second, third, and so on. Thus, unsuspecting drinkers are quickly and easily made intoxicated and possibly brought to stupor from the contents of the flagon. The container is usable a maximum of three times per day.'
